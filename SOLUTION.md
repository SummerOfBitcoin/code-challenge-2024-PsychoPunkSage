# **Work Documentation**

>> **The purpose of the work documentation is to offer transparency and clarity regarding the execution of tasks and the attainment of objectives. It serves as a reference point for evaluators to understand the workflow and rationale behind various actions undertaken during the project.**

>> **Disclaimer**

The limited number of commits visible in my project repository is attributed to the initial stages of development conducted within a sandbox environment. During this phase, I diligently iterated on the project, periodically pushing updates to the sandbox repository. Only after achieving a significant milestone and ensuring the quality and stability of the code did I transition it to my primary repository. This approach allowed for thorough testing and validation before committing to the main repository, ensuring that only appreciable progress was reflected in the public-facing version.
